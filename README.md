My name is Grant and I am a student currently studying Cybersecurity. I am passionate about learning new technologies and expanding my knowledge. 

On this profile, you will find a variety of projects that I have worked on, as well as some of the resources that I have used to learn more about coding. Feel free to explore my repositories and contact me if you have any questions or comments. 

I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with others, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you think we could work together on something. 

Thanks for visiting my profile!
